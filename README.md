# gurobi-case-study


In this case study, we are using Gurobi to help carriers from the paper mill to minimize the total shipping cost to 12 destinations that they serve. There are multiple constraints in order to find the optimized function and different cities have different stops, trips, and miles, and each carrier has different truckloads in transportation. Our goal in this study is to optimize the lowest possible cost to help carriers with the necessary truckloads requirements.
